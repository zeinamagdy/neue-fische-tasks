/*
Write a function called sumIntervals/sum_intervals() that accepts an array of intervals, and returns the sum of all the
interval lengths. Overlapping intervals should only be counted once.
Intervals
Intervals are represented by a pair of integers in the form of an array. The first value of the interval will always be
less than the second value. Interval example: [1, 5] is an interval from 1 to 5. The length of this interval is 4.
Overlapping Intervals
List containing overlapping intervals:
[
   [1,4],
   [7, 10],
   [3, 5]
]
The sum of the lengths of these intervals is 7. Since [1, 4] and [3, 5] overlap, we can treat the interval as [1, 5],
which has a length of 4.
